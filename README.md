# EZ-Rank
Android app where you can easily rank your favorite movies, music, or anything else!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: This app is in beta form, and downloading it requires allowing unknown app installs
on your phone. This setting is for your protection, so that you don't install an app that has
hidden malware. You will have to trust that my app is not malware. Additionally, EZ-Rank should
not cause any harm to your phone or its data, as it is a simple app that only requires
a small amount of local storage space which is deleted when you uninstall the app.
But I cannot guarantee this for your device. However, if you choose to download it and try it
out, I would greatly appreciate it! If you find any bugs or have a question/suggestion,
you can email me at karpenko.ryan@gmail.com .

To download the app to your phone:

From your phone browser, click on the ez-rank-debug-x.x.apk file, then download it.
When you open the file, you will be prompted to change your settings for installing unknown apps.
When you select "Settings" from this warning, you will be taken to an app permissions screen. For me it was for Chrome.
Change the permissions setting to "Yes" (or activate the toggle).
Go to your files on your phone, and find the recently downloaded .apk file.
Open it, and you will be prompted to install the app.
You may have to pass one final warning, after which your phone will download the app.
Enjoy!
