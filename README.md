WARNING:

This app is in beta form, and downloading it requires allowing installs of unknown apps on your phone. This is blocked by default for your protection, so that you don't install an app from outside the Play Store that has hidden malware. So you will have to trust that my app is not malware.

Additionally, EZ-Rank should not cause any harm to your phone or its data, as it is a simple app that only requires a small amount of local storage space which is deleted when you uninstall the app. However, I cannot guarantee that it will work perfectly for your device. But if you choose to download it and try it out, I would greatly appreciate it!

If you find any bugs or have a question/suggestion, you can email me at karpenko.ryan@gmail.com. 

INSTRUCTIONS TO DOWNLOAD:

(This is based on my experience installing the app on a Pixel 3a)

1) From your phone's web browser, click on the ez-rank-debug-x.x.apk file inside this repository, then download it.

2) When you open the file, you will be prompted to change your settings for installing unknown apps.

3) When you select "Settings" from this warning, you will be taken to an app permissions screen. For me it was permissions for Chrome.

4) Change the permissions setting to "Yes" (or activate the toggle).

5) Go to your files on your phone, and find the recently downloaded .apk file.

6) Open it, and you will be prompted to install the app.

7) You may have to pass one final warning, after which your phone will download the app.

8) Enjoy!
